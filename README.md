# Hi there, I'm @RAOUMERTC73 ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about **Verilog**, **FPGA**, **Digital Logic Design**, **RISC-V** architecture, and **Arduino**. I love diving into the world of hardware description languages and exploring innovative ways to design and implement digital systems.

### ðŸš€ What I'm Currently Up To:
- ðŸŒ± Pursuing a degree in **Telecommunication Engineering** with a focus on digital and analog communication systems.
- ðŸ”§ Working on exciting projects like:
  - [RISC-V Single-Cycle Core in Verilog](https://github.com/RAOUMERTC73/RISC-V-Single-Cycle-Core-in-Verilog)
  - [Design and Verification Trainee](https://github.com/RAOUMERTC73/-Design-and-Verification-Trainee)
  - [Quartus Prime Projects](https://github.com/RAOUMERTC73/Quartus_prime_FILE)
  - [Arduino ESP8266 Projects](https://github.com/RAOUMERTC73/Arduino_esp8266_Projects)

### ðŸ’¡ My Interests:
- **Verilog HDL**: Crafting logic circuits and architectures.
- **FPGA Development**: Turning code into hardware.
- **Digital Logic Design**: Building the foundational blocks of computing.
- **RISC-V Architecture**: Exploring the future of open-source hardware.
- **Arduino**: Prototyping and building IoT devices.
